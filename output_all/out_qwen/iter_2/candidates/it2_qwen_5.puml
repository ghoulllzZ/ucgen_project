' 删除图形必须先选择图形
UC4 .> UC3 : <<include>>
' 调整图形尺寸前必须选择图形
UC5 .> UC3 : <<include>>
' 移动图形需要先选择图形（隐含逻辑，虽未在must_include中但符合需求）
UC6 .> UC3 : <<include>>
' 创建新图层后自动设置为当前图层并初始化状态（根据需求7，需包含选择图形类型）
' 但“选择创建的图形类型”被禁止作为独立用例，因此不显式建模
' 管理图层包括切换图层和提示编号更新，但“切换图层”被禁，故仅保留管理行为本身

'
' Extend relationships: none required by must_include or valid extensions
' According to constraints, all proposed extends are either forbidden or not confirmed
'

'
' Notes:
' - Forbidden use cases like "切换图层", "显示初始界面", etc. are excluded.
' - Include from 删除图形 to 选择图形 is enforced by constraint.
' - No extend used due to lack of valid triggering conditions and forbidden extension targets.
' - Actor only: 用户
